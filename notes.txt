On Ubuntu, install bin86 to provide a 16-bit assembler and linker.
Scratch that, use nasm.

If you have the kvm-ipxe package installed, remove it.  If it is installed,
qemu will pause for several seconds on every single boot-up, apparently
because it's trying to boot from the network.

    - This one weighs in at 268 bytes of 32-bit code.

    - I hacked this one down to 619 bytes of 32-bit code.  I had to reverse
      a manual loop unrolling.

To implement disk swapping of INT13, you need to reserve EBDA space.  Look at
LILO's code for this -- it decrements a specific memory address in the 0x4xx
area, then calls "int 0x12".
